# üìö Dual-Space Documentation Update Summary

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes the documentation updates made to reflect the correct understanding of OpenLLM's two Hugging Face Spaces:

1. **[`lemms/llm`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lemms/llm)** - **Live Demo Space** for model inference and comparison
2. **[`lemms/openllm`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lemms/openllm)** - **Live Training Space** for interactive model training

## üìù Documentation Files Updated

### 1. **New File: `docs/HUGGING_FACE_SPACES_GUIDE.md`**
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide explaining both spaces and their different purposes

**Key Content Added**:
- **Detailed explanation** of each space's purpose and functionality
- **User experience guides** for both inference and training
- **Educational value** for different user types (students, researchers, developers)
- **Technical implementation** details and architecture
- **Performance comparison** between the two spaces
- **Getting started** instructions for both spaces

### 2. **Updated: `README.md`**
**Changes Made**:
- **Section title**: Changed from "Live Demo" to "Live Demos"
- **Added dual-space structure**: Separate sections for model testing and training
- **Updated links**: Added both space URLs with clear descriptions
- **Added reference**: Link to the detailed spaces guide
- **Updated footer**: Changed "Live Demo" to "Model Demo" and "Training Demo"

### 3. **Updated: `llm/README.md`**
**Changes Made**:
- **Added note**: Clarified this space is specifically for inference
- **Added cross-reference**: Link to the training space
- **Maintained focus**: Kept content focused on model testing and comparison

## üîç Key Corrections Made

### **Previous Understanding (Incorrect)**
- Both spaces were thought to be for model inference/demo
- No distinction between the purposes of the two spaces
- Limited explanation of the training capabilities

### **Current Understanding (Correct)**
- **`lemms/llm`**: Model inference, testing, and comparison
- **`lemms/openllm`**: Live model training with customizable parameters
- **Dual-purpose approach**: Complete AI workflow from training to usage
