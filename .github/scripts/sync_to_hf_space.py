Synchronization Script for OpenLLM Repository Structure

This script provides automated synchronization between the main GitHub repository 
and the Hugging Face Space repository. It maintains a clean separation of concerns
while ensuring that core training functionality is properly distributed across
different platforms.

The script performs the following key operations:
1. Sets up the Hugging Face Space repository structure
2. Copies essential training files from the main repo to the HF Space
3. Creates appropriate directory structures for training infrastructure
4. Generates HF Space-specific configuration files
5. Maintains version consistency between repositories

This approach enables:
- Centralized development in the main GitHub repository
- Distributed training capabilities in Hugging Face Spaces
- Automated synchronization to reduce manual maintenance
- Clear separation between core code and training infrastructure
