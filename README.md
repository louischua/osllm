# OpenLLM: Open Source Large Language Model

<!-- Copyright (C) 2024 Louis Chua Bean Chong -->
<!-- This file is part of OpenLLM - dual-licensed under GPLv3 and Commercial License -->

## 🌟 Overview

OpenLLM is an open source project to develop a powerful, flexible, and modular large language model (LLM) that is openly licensed under GPLv3 for research and community use, with a commercial license available for enterprise applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✔️ Pretraining and fine-tuning pipeline
- ✔️ Tokenizer training with SentencePiece or BPE
- ✔️ Support for multilingual datasets
- ✔️ Transformer-based architecture (GPT-like)
- ✔️ Model quantization and export for inference
- ✔️ Integration with Hugging Face, PyTorch, and ONNX
- ✔️ CLI and RESTful API for inference
- 🔒 Enterprise: RLHF trainer, fine-tuning UI, inference server orchestration (Kubernetes)

## 🧠 Design Goals

- Fully transparent and reproducible LLM stack
- Plug-and-play components (tokenizer, model, trainer)
- Scalable to billions of parameters
- Simple to extend with downstream tasks
