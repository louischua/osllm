# Deployment Fix - SPACE_ID Secret Added

## Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions deployment failed with "SPACE_ID is not set"
- **Solution**: Added `SPACE_ID` secret to GitHub repository secrets
- **Value**: `lemms/openllm`

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Add SPACE_ID secret to GitHub repository
2. ðŸ”„ This commit will trigger a new deployment
3. ðŸ“Š Monitor GitHub Actions for successful deployment

## Expected Results
- GitHub Actions should now have access to both required secrets:
  - `HF_TOKEN` - Hugging Face authentication
  - `SPACE_ID` - Target Space identifier
- Deployment should proceed to the "Deploy to Space" step
- Files should be successfully uploaded to the Hugging Face Space

## Verification
After deployment completes, check:
- https://github.com/louischua/osllm/actions (for successful workflow)
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/lemms/openllm (for updated Space)
